<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am a research fellow at the University of Nottingham with a PhD in Computer Science.</p>
<p>I work in the functional programming lab under the supervision of <a href="https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/">Graham Hutton</a>.</p>

<h2>Research interests</h2>
I am interested in formal verification and practical applications of type theory to general purpose programming. The aim of my research is to develop frameworks and tools for expressing, reasoning about and statically verifying properties of programs. At present my research focuses on <a href="https://github.com/brandonhewer/QuotientHaskell">Quotient Haskell</a>, which implements a class of quotient types for Haskell by extending <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">Liquid Haskell</a>.
